DevOps is a methodology integrating and automating the work of software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops). It serves as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.[1] DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile approach.

Automation is an important part of DevOps. Software programmers and architects should use "fitness functions" to keep their software in check.[2]

According to Neal Ford, DevOps, particularly through continuous delivery, employs the "Bring the pain forward" principle, tackling tough tasks early, fostering automation and swift issue detection. [3]

Definition
Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term "DevOps".[a][b][c][d] Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback. From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu—three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute—suggested defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality".[7] However, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a combination of specific practices, culture change, and tools.[8]

History
Proposals to combine software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts began to appear in the late 80s and early 90s.[9]

Around 2007 and 2008, concerns were raised by those within the software development and IT communities that the separation between the two industries, where one wrote and created software entirely separate from those that deploy and support the software was creating a fatal level of dysfunction within the industry.[10]

In 2009, the first conference named DevOps Days was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded by Belgian consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois.[11][12] The conference has now spread to other countries.[13]

In 2012, a report called "State of DevOps" was first published by Alanna Brown at Puppet Labs.[14][15]

As of 2014, the annual State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble and others. They stated that the adoption of DevOps was accelerating.[16][17] Also in 2014, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote the book More Agile Testing, containing a chapter on testing and DevOps.[18][19]

In 2016, the DORA metrics for throughput (deployment frequency, lead time for changes), and stability (mean time to recover, change failure rate) were published in the State of DevOps report.[14] However, the research methodology and metrics were criticized by experts.[20][21][22][23] In response to these criticisms, the 2023 State of DevOps report [24] published changes that updated the stability metric "mean time to recover" to "failed deployment recovery time" acknowledging the confusion the former metric has caused.
